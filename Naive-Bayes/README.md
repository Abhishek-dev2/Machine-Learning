# Assignment 3

### Naïve Bayes

Naïve Bayes comes under supervising machine learning which used to make classifications of data sets. It is used to predict things based on its prior knowledge and independence assumptions.

They call it naïve because it’s assumptions (it assumes that all of the features in the dataset are equally important and independent) are really optimistic and rarely true in most real-world applications.

It is classification algorithm which makes the decision for the unknown data set. It is based on [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) which describe the probability of an event based on its prior knowledge.

### Dependencies

We used python3 for writing the algorithm and were required these modules:
1. nltk

**Note:** Please run these commands before running the code.

```
import nltk
nltk.download()
```

**Running .ipynb notebooks using Jupyter Nootbook is preferred.**

### Usage

### Code

The assignment code is in the file `Naive-Bayes.ipynb` and respective python file is also provided.

#### How to run?

You can either run the jupyter notebooks by opening the .ipynb file which is preferred. Or you can also run their equivalent python file using python3.
